	<title>My Research</title>
	<p>Cooperation is fundamental to the organization of life, yet for Darwinian selection it presents a problem: how can traits that aid others evolve and persist? Not only do individuals cooperate among themselves to form complex societies, but our bodies could not live without cooperation among cells or among the genes in the genome. Life on earth required the cooperation of self-replicating molecules into genes, and each of the major evolutionary transitions similarly required cooperation among the interacting units (Maynard Smith & Szathm√°ry 1995). This included the transitions to eukaryotic cells, multicellularity, and animal societies. My [PhD lab] studies the evolution of the most extreme form of cooperation, altruism, in the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum and other organisms. Even though some of my research does not involve amoebae, I share their deep interest in how extreme cooperation evolves and is maintained.</p>
