<p>For my PhD, I have investigated the genomic signatures of conflict during cooperative acts. Conflict from social interactions is likely to be an important driver of molecular variation within and between species. Some of the best examples of how social interactions shape the genome come from studies of genetic conflicts between hosts and their pathogens. In these systems, evolutionary arms race dynamics drive patterns of rapid evolution and positive selection through repeated, alternating bouts of rapid adaptation between two parties. 
<br>
</br>Studies of arms race dynamics have revealed commonalities in the patterns of molecular variation arising from these interactions. This molecular 'signature' of conflict is the same as it is for strong adaptation: rapid evolution of proteins with an excess of non-synonymous divergence between species relative to non-synonymous polymorphism. <b>An under-explored aspect is how molecular variation has been shaped by genetic conflicts between individuals involved in cooperative actions. </b>In my doctoral work, it has been my primary aim to better understand how conflict genes evolve at the molecular level — and to ask whether we can use these patterns to predict putative conflict genes in future scenarios.

Although often overlooked, sexual reproduction is a highly cooperative enterprise. Genes are usually distributed via a "fair meiosis" but genomic imprinting deviates from this. Imprinting, or parent-of-origin specific gene expression, results from a chemical memory that identifies an allele’s parental origin via epigenetic modification of the chromatin or DNA. This chemical memory can be at the locus itself or at modifier loci. The result is modified allelic expression that depends on whether it comes from the female (matrigene) or male (patrigene) germline. Although much is now understood about the proximate mechanisms of imprinting in several taxa, including both mammals and angiosperms, its ultimate causes are less clear. One hypothesis that successfully explains the observed distribution and phenotypic effects of imprinted loci is the kinship theory of imprinting<a name="1.">[2]</a>. The kinship theory argues that genomic imprinting is an evolutionary consequence of conflict between maternal and paternal genomes over maternal investment.</p>

<p>As part of my dissertation, I have been asking whether the imprinted loci from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> have a sequence evolution pattern that suggests a history of conflict. I have also asked whether greater relatedness asymmetries, as results from increased outcrossing, is reflected in the molecular evolution of these loci by using data from <i>A. lyrata</i>.</p>
